/* Device memory.
 * Memory attributes for device memory consist of 3 params:
 * G or nG - Gathering or Non-Gathering
 * R or nR - Reordering or Non-Reordering
 * E or nE - Execution of No Execution bit 
 * Gathering means if multiple accesses to memory can be combined in
 * one big access.
 *
 * Reordering means if the data bus controller can reorder reads or writes
 * to memory in optimized order
 *
 * Execution bit means if confirmation of a write operation to memory must
 * be given when the data has actually landed the target address or not

/* Normal memory
 * Consists of 2 packs of parameters - for Inner and Outer shareability
 * For both inner and outer shareable types the cache might be
 *  - Write-Through - data written to memory is written both to cache and to
                      target memory
 *  - Write-Back    - data is only written to cache and then when evicted
 *                    written to memory
 *  - Non-Cacheable at all 
 *  - Transient / NonTransient - a hint for cache system, wheather to put the
 *                               data into cache or not
 * All cacheable types also have Read Allocate / Write allocate possible
 * policies.
 * Read Allocate - data will be put to cache to read.
 * Write Allocate - data will be put to cache at write or at read.
 *
 * Write-Back Write Allocate Transient Normal Cache
 * Would mean that at write operation the target memory location would be 
 * first put to cache (Write Allocate), then written in cache and marked as
 * dirty.
 * Later when the cache should be eviceted, the dirty flag would tell the
 * system to write cache contents to memory.
